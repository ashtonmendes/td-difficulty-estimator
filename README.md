# td-difficulty-estimator

This project was started by students at USC's game pipe lab. The goal of the project is to aid and assist level designers of tower defense games, by providing some kind of feedback
as and when the level designers change certain parameters of the game. While designing levels for tower defense games, the level designers have to do it in such a way that the level is
neither very easy nor extremely difficult. For this, they have to try out various combinations of monsters, towers, tower positions, the map of the level, etc. As you can imagine, this is a very cumbersome and time-consuming process as there is some amount of trial and error involved. In an effort to help level designers, we provide some estimates, based on some statistical calculations, which tells the level designer how easy or difficult a level is.
